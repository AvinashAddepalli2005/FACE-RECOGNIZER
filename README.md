# FACE-RECOGNIZER
This program uses OpenCV for real-time face detection via webcam. It captures frames, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces using a Haar Cascade model. Detected faces are highlighted with green rectangles. The video displays live, and the program exits when the 'a' key is pressed, releasing resources and closing windows.
